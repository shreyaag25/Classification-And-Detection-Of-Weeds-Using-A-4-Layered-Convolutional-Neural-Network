# Classification-And-Detection-Of-Weeds-Using-A-4-Layered-Convolutional-Neural-Network

ðŸ“Œ This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on the classification and detection of weeds affecting soybean crops using a 4-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal of this project is to provide a practical solution to help farmers identify and manage weed infestations in their soybean fields, ultimately improving crop yield.

ðŸ“Œ We have used a dataset of soybean field images, which is not included in this repository due to its size. You can obtain the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fpeccia/weed-detection-in-soybean-crops] and place it in the dataset/ directory. Make sure to follow the dataset's licensing terms and citation requirements.
